Background and Objective: Neuroblastoma (NB), the most common pediatric solid 
tumor apart from brain tumor, is associated with dismal long-term survival. The 
aim of this study was to identify a gene signature to predict the prognosis of 
NB patients. Materials and Methods: GSE49710 dataset from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) database was downloaded and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
were analyzed using R package "limma" and SPSS software. The gene ontology (GO) 
and pathway enrichment analysis were established via DAVID database. Random 
forest (RF) and risk score model were used to pick out the gene signature in 
predicting the prognosis of NB patients. Simultaneously, the receiving operating 
characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier curve were plotted. GSE45480 and GSE16476 
datasets were employed to validate the robustness of the gene signature. 
Results: A total of 131 DEGs were identified, which were mainly enriched in 
cancer-related pathways. Four genes (ERCC6L, AHCY, STK33, and NCAN) were 
selected as a gene signature, which was included in the top six important 
features in RF model, to predict the prognosis in NB patients, its area under 
the curve (AUC) could reach 0.86, and Cox regression analysis revealed that the 
4-gene signature was an independent prognostic factor of overall survival and 
event-free survival. As well as in GSE16476. Additionally, the robustness of 
discriminating different groups of the 4-gene signature was verified to have a 
commendable performance in GSE45480 and GSE49710. Conclusion: The present study 
identified a gene-signature in predicting the prognosis in NB, which may provide 
novel prognostic markers, and some of the genes may be as treatment targets 
according to biological experiments in the future.

Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is the most common brain tumor characterized by a 
dismal prognosis. GBM cancer stem cells (gCSC) or tumor-initiating cells are the 
cell population within the tumor-driving therapy resistance and recurrence. 
While temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating agent, constitutes the first-line 
chemotherapeutic significantly improving survival in GBM patients, resistance 
against this compound commonly leads to GBM recurrence and treatment failure. 
Although the roles of protein-coding transcripts, proteins and microRNA in gCSC, 
and therapy resistance have been comprehensively investigated, very little is 
known about the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in this context. Using 
nonoverlapping, independent RNA sequencing and gene expression profiling 
datasets, we reveal that TP73-AS1 constitutes a clinically relevant lncRNA in 
GBM. Specifically, we demonstrate significant overexpression of TP73-AS1 in 
primary GBM samples, which is particularly increased in the gCSC. More 
importantly, we demonstrate that TP73-AS1 comprises a prognostic biomarker in 
glioma and in GBM with high expression identifying patients with particularly 
poor prognosis. Using CRISPRi to downregulate our candidate lncRNA in gCSC, we 
demonstrate that TP73-AS1 promotes TMZ resistance in gCSC and is linked to 
regulation of the expression of metabolism- related genes and ALDH1A1, a protein 
known to be expressed in cancer stem cell markers and protects gCSC from TMZ 
treatment. Taken together, our results reveal that high TP73-AS1 predicts poor 
prognosis in primary GBM cohorts and that this lncRNA promotes tumor 
aggressiveness and TMZ resistance in gCSC.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common 
childhood cancer worldwide. Mexican patients have high mortality rates, low 
frequency of good prognosis biomarkers (i.e., ETV6-RUNX1) and a high proportion 
is classified at the time of diagnosis with a high risk to relapse according to 
clinical features. In addition, very early relapses are more frequently observed 
than in other populations. The aim of the study was to identify new potential 
biomarkers associated with very early relapse in Mexican ALL children through 
transcriptome analysis.
METHODS: Microarray gene expression profiling on bone marrow samples of 54 
pediatric ALL patients, collected at time of diagnosis and/or at relapse, was 
performed. Eleven patients presented relapse within the first 18 months after 
diagnosis. Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 (HTA 2.0) was used to 
perform gene expression analysis. Annotation and functional enrichment analyses 
were carried out using Gene Ontology, KEGG pathway analysis and Ingenuity 
Pathway Analysis tools.
RESULTS: BLVRB, ZCCHC7, PAX5, EBF1, TMOD1 and BLNK were differentially expressed 
(fold-change >2.0 and p value <0.01) between relapsed and non-relapsed patients. 
Functional analysis of abnormally expressed genes revealed their important role 
in cellular processes related to the development of hematological diseases, 
cancer, cell death and survival and in cell-to-cell signaling interaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support previous findings showing the relevance of PAX5, 
EBF1 and ZCCHC7 as potential biomarkers to identify a subgroup of ALL children 
in high risk to relapse.

BACKGROUND: Bereaved parents experience significant psychosocial and health 
sequelae, suggesting that this population may benefit from the ongoing extension 
of support and resources throughout the grief journey. The interaction of 
hospital staff with patients and families at the end of a child's life and after 
death profoundly affects parental grief, offering a unique opportunity for the 
medical community to positively impact the bereavement experience. The current 
study was conducted to explore the role of the health care team and medical 
institutions in the grief journeys of parents whose child died a cancer-related 
death.
METHODS: Eleven bereaved parents participated in 2 focus groups. Responses to 
each of the 3 main prompts were coded and analyzed independently using semantic 
content analysis techniques.
RESULTS: Four main concepts were identified within the parental narratives, 
including the importance of strong and ongoing relationships between providers 
and bereaved families, the importance of high-quality communication, the effect 
of negative experiences between providers and families on parental grief, and 
the importance of the institution's role in the grief journeys of bereaved 
parents.
CONCLUSIONS: Bereaved parents consistently identified the critical role played 
by medical staff and medical institutions throughout the grief journey. Key 
components of bereavement support identified by parents should serve to guide 
the actions of providers as well as provide a template for the development of a 
comprehensive bereavement program within an institution. Cancer 2016. © 2016

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer. Owing to 
the incorporation of risk-adapted therapy and the arrival of new directed 
agents, the cure rate and survival of patients with ALL have improved 
dramatically, get near to 90%. In Latin American countries, the mortality rates 
of ALL are high, for example in Colombia, during the last decade, ALL has been 
the most prevalent cancer among children between 0-14 years of age. In the face 
of this public health problem and coupled with the fact that the knowledge of 
the proteome of the child population is little, our investigation proposes the 
study of the plasma proteome of Colombian children diagnosed with B-cell ALL 
(B-ALL) to determine potential disease markers that could reflect processes 
altered by the presence of the disease or in response to it. A proteomic study 
by LC-MS/MS and quantification by label-free methods were performed in search of 
proteins differentially expressed between healthy children and those diagnosed 
with B-ALL. We quantified a total of 472 proteins in depleted blood plasma, and 
25 of these proteins were differentially expressed (fold change >2, 
Bonferroni-adjusted P-values <0.05). Plasma Aggrecan core protein, 
alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, coagulation factor XIII A chain and gelsolin protein 
were examined by ELISA assay and compared to shotgun proteomics results. Our 
data provide new information on the plasma proteome of Colombian children. 
Additionally, these proteins may also have certain potential as illness markers 
or as therapeutic targets in subsequent investigations.

BACKGROUND: Perifosine, is a third generation alkylphospholipid analog which has 
promising anti-tumor efficacy in clinical trials of refractory/recurrent 
neuroblastoma (NB). However, perifosine's mechanism of action remains unclear. 
Previously, we have shown that perifosine changes global proteome and acetylome 
profiles in NB.
METHODS: To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the perifosine 
mechanism, we performed a quantitative assessment of the lysine ubiquitylome in 
SK-N-AS NB cells using SILAC labeling, affinity enrichment and high-resolution 
liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry analysis. To analyse the 
data of ubiquitylome, we performed enrichment analysis with gene ontology (GO), 
the Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, ubiquitylated lysine 
motif, protein complex and protein domain. Protein-protein interaction was 
conducted to explore the crosstalk between ubiquitylome and previous global 
proteome/acetylome. Co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting were used to 
validate the results of the ubiquitylome analysis.
RESULTS: Altogether, 3,935 sites and 1,658 proteins were quantified. These 
quantified ubiquitylated proteins participated in various cellular processes 
such as binding, catalytic activity, biological regulation, metabolic process 
and signaling pathways involving non-homologous end-joining, steroid 
biosynthesis and Ras signaling pathway. Ubiquitylome and proteome presented 
negative connection. We identified 607 sites which were modified with both 
ubiquitination and acetylation. We selected 14 proteins carrying differentially 
quantified lysine ubiquitination and acetylation sites at the threshold of 1.5 
folds as potential targets. These proteins were enriched in activities 
associated with ribosome, cell cycle and metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study extends our understanding of the spectrum of novel 
targets that are differentially ubiquitinated after perifosine treatment of NB 
tumor cells.

BACKGROUND: The Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA) is an 
ongoing, global, community-driven effort to evaluate and improve the 
computational annotation of protein function.
RESULTS: Here, we report on the results of the third CAFA challenge, CAFA3, that 
featured an expanded analysis over the previous CAFA rounds, both in terms of 
volume of data analyzed and the types of analysis performed. In a novel and 
major new development, computational predictions and assessment goals drove some 
of the experimental assays, resulting in new functional annotations for more 
than 1000 genes. Specifically, we performed experimental whole-genome mutation 
screening in Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aureginosa genomes, which provided 
us with genome-wide experimental data for genes associated with biofilm 
formation and motility. We further performed targeted assays on selected genes 
in Drosophila melanogaster, which we suspected of being involved in long-term 
memory.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that while predictions of the molecular function and 
biological process annotations have slightly improved over time, those of the 
cellular component have not. Term-centric prediction of experimental annotations 
remains equally challenging; although the performance of the top methods is 
significantly better than the expectations set by baseline methods in C. 
albicans and D. melanogaster, it leaves considerable room and need for 
improvement. Finally, we report that the CAFA community now involves a broad 
range of participants with expertise in bioinformatics, biological 
experimentation, biocuration, and bio-ontologies, working together to improve 
functional annotation, computational function prediction, and our ability to 
manage big data in the era of large experimental screens.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive malignancy 
originating from T-cell precursors. The genetic landscape of T-ALL has been 
largely characterized by next-generation sequencing. Yet, the transcriptome of 
miRNAs (miRNome) of T-ALL has been less extensively studied. Using small RNA 
sequencing, we characterized the miRNome of 34 pediatric T-ALL samples, 
including the expression of isomiRs and the identification of candidate novel 
miRNAs (not previously annotated in miRBase). For the first time, we show that 
immunophenotypic subtypes of T-ALL present different miRNA expression profiles. 
To extend miRNome characteristics in T-ALL (to 82 T-ALL cases), we combined our 
small RNA-seq results with data available in Gene Expression Omnibus. We report 
on miRNAs most abundantly expressed in pediatric T-ALL and miRNAs differentially 
expressed in T-ALL versus normal mature T-lymphocytes and thymocytes, 
representing candidate oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs. Using eight target 
prediction algorithms and pathway enrichment analysis, we identified 
differentially expressed miRNAs and their predicted targets implicated in 
processes (defined in Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) 
of potential importance in pathogenesis of T-ALL, including 
interleukin-6-mediated signaling, mTOR signaling, and regulation of apoptosis. 
We finally focused on hsa-mir-106a-363 cluster and functionally validated direct 
interactions of hsa-miR-20b-5p and hsa-miR-363-3p with 3' untranslated regions 
of their predicted targets (PTEN, SOS1, LATS2), overrepresented in regulation of 
apoptosis. hsa-mir-106a-363 is a paralogue of prototypic oncogenic hsa-mir-17-92 
cluster with yet unestablished role in the pathogenesis of T-ALL. Our study 
provides a firm basis and data resource for functional analyses on the role of 
miRNA-mRNA interactions in T-ALL.

STUDY QUESTION: Could the follicle proteome be mapped by identifying specific 
proteins that are common or differ between three developmental stages from the 
secondary follicle (SF) to the antrum-like stage?
SUMMARY ANSWER: From a total of 1401 proteins identified in the follicles, 609 
were common to the three developmental stages investigated and 444 were found 
uniquely at one of the stages.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The importance of the follicle as a functional structure 
has been recognized; however, up-to-date the proteome of the whole follicle has 
not been described. A few studies using proteomics have previously reported on 
either isolated fully-grown oocytes before or after meiosis resumption or 
cumulus cells.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The experimental design included a validated mice 
model for isolation and individual culture of SFs. The system was chosen as it 
allows continuous evaluation of follicle growth and selection of follicles for 
analysis at pre-determined developmental stages: SF, complete Slavjanski 
membrane rupture (SMR) and antrum-like cavity (AF). The experiments were 
repeated 13 times independently to acquire the material that was analyzed by 
proteomics.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: SFs (n = 2166) were isolated from 
B6CBA/F1 female mice (n = 42), 12 days old, from 15 l. About half of the 
follicles isolated as SF were analyzed as such (n = 1143) and pooled to obtain 
139 μg of extracted protein. Both SMR (n = 359) and AF (n = 124) were obtained 
after individual culture of 1023 follicles in a microdrop system under oil, 
selected for analysis and pooled, to obtain 339 μg and 170 μg of protein, 
respectively. The follicle proteome was analyzed combining isoelectric focusing 
(IEF) fractionation with 1D and 2D LC-MS/MS analysis to enhance protein 
identification. The three protein lists were submitted to the 'Compare gene 
list' tool in the PANTHER website to gain insights on the Gene Ontology 
Biological processes present and to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to highlight 
protein networks. A label-free quantification was performed with 1D LC-MS/MS 
analyses to emphasize proteins with different expression profiles between the 
three follicular stages. Supplementary western blot analysis (using new 
biological replicates) was performed to confirm the expression variations of 
three proteins during follicle development in vitro.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: It was found that 609 out of 1401 
identified proteins were common to the three follicle developmental stages 
investigated. Some proteins were identified uniquely at one stage: 71 of the 775 
identified proteins in SF, 181 of 1092 in SMR and 192 of 1100 in AF. Additional 
qualitative and quantitative analysis highlighted 44 biological processes 
over-represented in our samples compared to the Mus musculus gene database. In 
particular, it was possible to identify proteins implicated in the cell cycle, 
calcium ion binding and glycolysis, with specific expressions and abundance, 
throughout in vitro follicle development.
LARGE SCALE DATA: Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier 
PXD006227.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The proteome analyses described in this study 
were performed after in vitro development. Despite fractionation of the samples 
before LC-MS/MS, proteomic approaches are not exhaustive, thus proteins that are 
not identified in a group are not necessarily absent from that group, although 
they are likely to be less abundant.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study allowed a general view of 
proteins implicated in follicle development in vitro and it represents the most 
complete catalog of the whole follicle proteome available so far. Not only were 
well known proteins of the oocyte identified but also proteins that are probably 
expressed only in granulosa cells.
STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was supported by the Portuguese 
Foundation for Science and Technology, FCT (PhD fellowship SFRH/BD/65299/2009 to 
A.A.), the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation (PR 2014-0144 to K.A.R-.W.) and 
Stockholm County Council to K.A.R-.W. The authors of the study have no conflict 
of interest to report.

Neuroblastoma is a very heterogeneous tumor of childhood. The clinical spectra 
range from very aggressive metastatic disease to spontaneous regression, even 
without therapy. Aberrant DNA methylation pattern is a common feature of most 
cancers. For neuroblastoma, it has been demonstrated both for single genes as 
well as genome-wide, where a so-called methylator phenotype has been described. 
Here, we present a study using Illumina 450K methylation arrays on 60 
neuroblastoma tumors. We show that aggressive tumors, characterized by 
International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) as stage M, are hypermethylated 
compared to low-grade tumors. On the contrary, INRG stage L tumors display more 
non-CpG methylation. The genes with the highest number of hypermethylated CpG 
sites in INRG M tumors are TERT, PCDHGA4, DLX5, and DLX6-AS1. Gene ontology 
analysis showed a representation of neuronal tumor relevant gene functions among 
the differentially methylated genes. For validation, we used a set of 
independent tumors previously analyzed with the Illumina 27K methylation arrays, 
which confirmed the differentially methylated sites. Top candidate genes with 
aberrant methylation were analyzed for altered gene expression through the R2 
platform ( http://r2.amc.nl), and for correlations between methylation and gene 
expression in a public dataset. Altered expression in nonsurvivors was found for 
the genes B3GALT4 and KIAA1949, CLIC5, DLX6-AS, TERT, and PIRT, and strongest 
correlations were found for TRIM36, KIAA0513, and PIRT. Our data indicate that 
methylation profiling can be used for patient stratification and informs on 
epigenetically deregulated genes with the potential of increasing our knowledge 
about the underlying mechanisms of tumor development.

Neuroblastoma accounts for 15% of childhood cancer mortality. Amplification of 
the oncogene N-Myc is a well-established poor prognostic marker for 
neuroblastoma. Whilst N-Myc amplification status strongly correlates with higher 
tumour aggression and resistance to treatment, the role of N-Myc in the 
aggressiveness of the disease is poorly understood. Exosomes are released by 
many cell types including cancer cells and are implicated as key mediators in 
cell-cell communication via the transfer of molecular cargo. Hence, 
characterising the exosomal protein components from N-Myc amplified and 
non-amplified neuroblastoma cells will improve our understanding on their role 
in the progression of neuroblastoma. In this study, a comparative proteomic 
analysis of exosomes isolated from cells with varying N-Myc amplification status 
was performed. Label-free quantitative proteomic profiling revealed 968 proteins 
that are differentially abundant in exosomes released by the neuroblastoma 
cells. Gene ontology-based analysis highlighted the enrichment of proteins 
involved in cell communication and signal transduction in N-Myc amplified 
exosomes. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with N-Myc amplified SK-N-BE2 cell-derived 
exosomes increased the migratory potential, colony forming abilities and 
conferred resistance to doxorubicin induced apoptosis. Incubation of exosomes 
from N-Myc knocked down SK-N-BE2 cells abolished the transfer of resistance to 
doxorubicin induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that exosomes could play a 
pivotal role in N-Myc-driven aggressive neuroblastoma and transfer of 
chemoresistance between cells. Abbreviations: RNA = ribonucleic acid; DNA =

STUDY QUESTION: Does the X chromosome inactivation (XCI) of Klinefelter syndrome 
(KS)-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) correspond to female 
human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and reflect the KS genotype?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Our results demonstrate for the first time that KS-derived 
hiPSCs show similar XCI behavior to female hPSCs in culture and show biological 
relevance to KS genotype-related clinical features.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: So far, assessment of XCI of KS-derived hiPSCs was based 
on H3K27me3 staining and X-inactive specific transcript gene expression 
disregarding the at least three XCI states (XaXi with XIST coating, XaXi lacking 
XIST coating, and XaXe (partially eroded XCI)) that female hPSCs display in 
culture.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study used hiPSC lines generated from two 
azoospermic patients with KS and included two healthy male (HM) and one healthy 
female donor.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In this study, we derived hiPSCs by 
reprograming fibroblasts with episomal plasmids and applying laminin 521 as 
culture substrate. hiPSCs were characterized by karyotyping, 
immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, teratoma formation, 
and embryoid body differentiation. XCI and KS hiPSC relevance were assessed by 
whole genome transcriptomics analysis and immunocytochemistry plus FISH of KS, 
HM and female fibroblast, and their hiPSC derivatives.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Applying whole genome transcriptomics 
analysis, we could identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between KS and 
HM donors with enrichment in gene ontology terms associated with fertility, 
cardiovascular development, ossification, and brain development, all associated 
with KS genotype-related clinical features. Furthermore, XCI analysis based on 
transcriptomics data, RNA FISH, and H3K27me3 staining revealed variable XCI 
states of KS hiPSCs similar to female hiPSCs, showing either normal (XaXi) or 
eroded (XaXe) XCI. KS hiPSCs with normal XCI showed nevertheless upregulated 
X-linked genes involved in nervous system development as well as synaptic 
transmission, supporting the potential use of KS-derived hiPSCs as an in vitro 
model for KS.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Detailed clinical information for patients 
included in this study was not available. Although a correlation between DEGs 
and the KS genotype could be observed, the biological relevance of these cells 
has to be confirmed with further experiments. In addition, karyotype analysis 
for two hiPSC lines was performed at passage 12 but not repeated at a later 
passage. Nevertheless, since all XCI experiments for those lines were performed 
between passage 11 and 15 the authors expect no karyotypic changes for those 
experiments.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: As KS patients have variable clinical 
phenotypes that are influenced by the grade of aneuploidy, mosaicism, origin of 
the X chromosome, and XCI 'escapee' genes, which vary not only among individuals 
but also among different tissues within the same individual, differentiated KS 
hiPSCs could be used for a better understanding of KS pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Advances in the application of genetic technologies reveal a growing 
number of heritable disorders associated with an increased risk to develop 
cancer during childhood. As genetic testing is increasingly employed in the 
clinical setting, it is essential to understand whether parents communicate with 
their children about test results and to elucidate the factors that influence 
the content and outcomes of these conversations.
METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 14 parents whose children 
tested positive for Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Semantic content analysis was 
performed on transcribed interviews, focusing on questions related to 
parent-child conversations about the genetic testing process and disclosure of 
positive test results.
RESULTS: All parents emphasized the importance of involving children in 
conversations about LFS. The majority (93%) identified as being part of "cancer 
families" in which prior experiences with cancer created opportunities for 
communication. While all had spoken with their children about cancer, only seven 
(50%) specifically disclosed to their children that they had tested positive for 
LFS. The most common reason cited for nondisclosure at the time of this study 
was the young age of the children.
CONCLUSION: Parents of children with LFS desire open conversations about genetic 
testing and cancer risk. These conversations are challenging yet essential to 
enable child understanding of genetic risk status and enhance compliance with 
health-promoting and cancer surveillance measures. Development of 
age-appropriate educational materials and novel clinical models to facilitate 
parent-child conversations about genetic test results and risk status for cancer 
are needed.

In humans, fetal erythropoiesis takes place in the liver whereas adult 
erythropoiesis occurs in the bone marrow. Fetal and adult erythroid cells are 
not only produced at different sites, but are also distinguished by their 
respective transcriptional program. In particular, whereas fetal erythroid cells 
express γ-globin chains to produce fetal hemoglobin (HbF), adult cells express 
β-globin chains to generate adult hemoglobin. Understanding the transcriptional 
regulation of the fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switch is clinically important as 
re-activation of HbF production in adult erythroid cells would represent a 
promising therapy for the hemoglobin disorders sickle cell disease and 
β-thalassemia. We used RNA-sequencing to measure global gene and microRNA 
(miRNA) expression in human erythroblasts derived ex vivo from fetal liver (n = 
12 donors) and bone marrow (n = 12 donors) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. 
We identified 7829 transcripts and 402 miRNA that were differentially expressed 
(false discovery rate <5%). The miRNA expression patterns were replicated in an 
independent collection of human erythroblasts using a different technology. By 
combining gene and miRNA expression data, we developed transcriptional networks 
which show substantial differences between fetal and adult human erythroblasts. 
Our analyses highlighted the miRNAs at the imprinted 14q32 locus in fetal 
erythroblasts and the let-7 miRNA family in adult erythroblasts as key 
regulators of stage-specific erythroid transcriptional programs. Altogether, our 
results provide a comprehensive resource to prioritize genes that may modify 
clinical severity in red blood cell (RBC) disorders, or genes that might be 
implicated in erythropoiesis by genome-wide association studies of RBC traits.

BACKGROUND: The interaction of health care providers and hospital staff with 
patients and families at the end of life affects the parental grief experience. 
Both verbal and nonverbal communication are key components of this interaction.
OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to explore the communication between hospital 
staff members and patients and families at the time of patients' health decline 
near the end of life.
METHODS: Twelve bereaved parents participated in a focus group. Semantic content 
analysis was used to analyze the transcript.
RESULTS: Parents' responses to the prompt about typical ways the medical team 
communicated yielded 109 codes, which were grouped into 12 themes. The most 
common themes were "patient inclusion" and "explanation of medical plan," both 
used in 17% of responses. Responses to the prompt about positive and negative 
aspects of communication generated 208 codes, yielding 15 different themes. The 
most common theme about positive communication was the "strong relationship 
between family and staff." The theme "variations in care with a negative impact" 
was used most frequently in describing negative communication.
CONCLUSION: This study helps to identify techniques that should be used by 
clinicians as they work with children with cancer and their families, 
particularly including patients in treatment decisions, ongoing relationship 
building, communicating with caring and empathy, using an interdisciplinary team 
for additional support, and pairing bad news with a plan of action.

BACKGROUND: Retinoblastoma is a pediatric eye cancer associated with RB1 loss or 
MYCN amplification (RB1 (+/+) MYCN(A) ). There are controversies concerning the 
existence of molecular subtypes within RB1(-/-) retinoblastoma. To test whether 
these molecular subtypes exist, we performed molecular profiling.
METHODS: Genome-wide mRNA expression profiling was performed on 76 primary human 
retinoblastomas. Expression profiling was complemented by genome-wide DNA 
profiling and clinical, histopathological, and ex vivo drug sensitivity data.
FINDINGS: RNA and DNA profiling identified major variability between 
retinoblastomas. While gene expression differences between RB1 (+/+) MYCN(A) and 
RB1(-/-) tumors seemed more dichotomous, differences within the RB1(-/-) tumors 
were gradual. Tumors with high expression of a photoreceptor gene signature were 
highly differentiated, smaller in volume and diagnosed at younger age compared 
with tumors with low photoreceptor signature expression. Tumors with lower 
photoreceptor expression showed increased expression of genes involved in 
M-phase and mRNA and ribosome synthesis and increased frequencies of somatic 
copy number alterations.
INTERPRETATION: Molecular, clinical and histopathological differences between 
RB1(-/-) tumors are best explained by tumor progression, reflected by a gradual 
loss of differentiation and photoreceptor expression signature. Since copy 
number alterations were more frequent in tumors with less photoreceptorness, 
genomic alterations might be drivers of tumor progression.
RESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Retinoblastoma is an ocular childhood cancer commonly 
caused by mutations in the RB1 gene. In order to determine optimal treatment, 
tumor subtyping is considered critically important. However, except for very 
rare retinoblastomas without an RB1 mutation, there are controversies as to 
whether subtypes of retinoblastoma do exist. Our study shows that 
retinoblastomas are highly diverse but rather than reflecting distinct tumor 
types with a different etiology, our data suggests that this diversity is a 
result of tumor progression driven by cumulative genetic alterations. Therefore, 
retinoblastomas should not be categorized in distinct subtypes, but be described 
according to their stage of progression.

Predictive models can support physicians to tailor interventions and treatments 
to their individual patients based on their predicted response and risk of 
disease and help in this way to put personalized medicine into practice. In 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation risk assessment is to be enhanced in order 
to respond to emerging viral infections and transplantation reactions. However, 
to develop predictive models it is necessary to harmonize and integrate high 
amounts of heterogeneous medical data that is stored in different health 
information systems. Driven by the demand for predictive instruments in 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation we present in this paper an ontology-based 
platform that supports data owners and model developers to share and harmonize 
their data for model development respecting data privacy.

Technological advances now allow us to rapidly produce CARs and other 
antibody-derived therapeutics targeting cell surface receptors. To maximize the 
potential of these new technologies, relevant extracellular targets must be 
identified. The Pediatric Oncology Branch of the NCI curates a freely accessible 
database of gene expression data for both pediatric cancers and normal tissues, 
through which we have defined discrete sets of over-expressed transcripts in 12 
pediatric cancer subtypes as compared to normal tissues. We coupled gene 
expression profiles to current annotation databases (i.e., Affymetrix, Gene 
Ontology, Entrez Gene), in order to categorize transcripts by their sub-cellular 
location. In this manner we generated a list of potential immune targets 
expressed on the cell surface, ranked by their difference from normal tissue. 
Global differences from normal between each of the pediatric tumor types studied 
varied, indicating that some malignancies expressed transcript sets that were 
more highly diverged from normal tissues than others. The validity of our 
approach is seen by our findings for pre-B cell ALL, where targets currently in 
clinical trials were top-ranked hits (CD19, CD22). For some cancers, reagents 
already in development could potentially be applied to a new disease class, as 
exemplified by CD30 expression on sarcomas. Moreover, several potential new 
targets shared among several pediatric solid tumors are herein identified, such 
as MCAM (MUC18), metadherin (MTDH), and glypican-2 (GPC2). These targets have 
been identified at the mRNA level and are yet to be validated at the protein 
level. The safety of targeting these antigens has yet to be demonstrated and 
therefore the identified transcripts should be considered preliminary candidates 
for new CAR and therapeutic antibody targets. Prospective candidate targets will 
be evaluated by proteomic analysis including Westerns and immunohistochemistry 
of normal and tumor tissues.

BACKGROUND: Precise nucleosome positioning is an increasingly recognized feature 
of promoters and enhancers, reflecting complex contributions of DNA sequence, 
nucleosome positioning, histone modification and transcription factor binding to 
enhancer activity and regulation of gene expression. Changes in nucleosome 
position and occupancy, histone variants and modifications, and chromatin 
remodeling are also critical elements of dynamic transcriptional regulation, but 
poorly understood at enhancers. We investigated glucocorticoid 
receptor-associated (GR) nucleosome dynamics at enhancers in acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia.
RESULTS: For the first time, we demonstrate functionally distinct modes of 
nucleosome remodeling upon chromatin binding by GR, which we term central, 
non-central, phased, and minimal. Central and non-central remodeling reflect 
nucleosome eviction by GR and cofactors, respectively. Phased remodeling 
involves nucleosome repositioning and is associated with rapidly activated 
enhancers and induction of gene expression. Minimal remodeling sites initially 
have low levels of enhancer-associated histone modification, but the majority of 
these regions gain H3K4me2 or H3K27Ac to become de novo enhancers. Minimal 
remodeling regions are associated with gene ontologies specific to decreased B 
cell number and mTOR inhibition and may make unique contributions to 
glucocorticoid-induced leukemia cell death.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings form a novel framework for understanding the dynamic 
interplay between transcription factor binding, nucleosome remodeling, enhancer 
function, and gene expression in the leukemia response to glucocorticoids.

In biomedical applications of machine learning, relevant information often has a 
rich structure that is not easily encoded as real-valued predictors. Examples of 
such data include DNA or RNA sequences, gene sets or pathways, gene interaction 
or coexpression networks, ontologies, and phylogenetic trees. We highlight 
recent examples of machine learning models that use structure to constrain model 
architecture or incorporate structured data into model training. For machine 
learning in biomedicine, where sample size is limited and model interpretability 
is crucial, incorporating prior knowledge in the form of structured data can be 
particularly useful. The area of research would benefit from performant open 
source implementations and independent benchmarking efforts.

OBJECTIVE: to present the cultural adaptation of the questionnaire Costs of 
caring for children with cancer, offering a valid and reliable tool to assess 
the economic repercussions of childhood cancer for Brazilian families.
METHOD: it is a methodological research with a cross-sectional design. The 
methodological framework to validate the questionnaire was a combined process 
that included seven steps: translation to Portuguese; first translated consensus 
version; evaluation by Expert Committee; consensus on the Expert Committee 
version; back-translation; consensus of back-translated versions; semantic 
validation. The study was conducted in two phases: phase one was the translation 
and back-translations process, with five expert committee members. Phase two was 
the semantic validation, with 24 participants, who answered an instrument about 
their impressions of the questionnaire and suggested modifications.
RESULTS: in phase one, items were included, excluded, and replaced to make the 
content equivalent and valid for use with Brazilian context. In phase two, the 
majority of the participants were mothers, who made suggestions about the 
relevance and clarity of the items in the questionnaire.
CONCLUSIONS: the authors discussed these recommendations and made adaptations, 
turning the questionnaire into a valid and reliable tool for application.

Metastatic melanoma remains a mostly incurable disease. Although newly approved 
targeted therapies are efficacious in a subset of patients, resistance and 
relapse rapidly ensue. Alternative therapeutic strategies to manipulate 
epigenetic regulators and disrupt the transcriptional program that maintains 
tumor cell identity are emerging. Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) 
proteins are epigenome readers known to exert key roles at the interface between 
chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Here, we report that BRD4, 
a BET family member, is significantly upregulated in primary and metastatic 
melanoma tissues compared with melanocytes and nevi. Treatment with BET 
inhibitors impaired melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth and 
metastatic behavior in vivo, effects that were mostly recapitulated by 
individual silencing of BRD4. RNA sequencing of BET inhibitor-treated cells 
followed by Gene Ontology analysis showed a striking impact on transcriptional 
programs controlling cell growth, proliferation, cell-cycle regulation, and 
differentiation. In particular, we found that, rapidly after BET displacement, 
key cell-cycle genes (SKP2, ERK1, and c-MYC) were downregulated concomitantly 
with the accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (p21 and p27), 
followed by cell-cycle arrest. Importantly, BET inhibitor efficacy was not 
influenced by BRAF or NRAS mutational status, opening the possibility of using 
these small-molecule compounds to treat patients for whom no effective targeted 
therapy exists. Collectively, our study reveals a critical role for BRD4 in 
melanoma tumor maintenance and renders it a legitimate and novel target for 
epigenetic therapy directed against the core transcriptional program of 
melanoma.

BACKGROUND: The prognosis of children with metastatic stage 4 neuroblastoma (NB) 
has remained poor in the past decade.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using microarray analyses of 342 primary tumors, we here 
developed and validated an easy to use gene expression-based risk score 
including 18 genes, which can robustly predict the outcome of stage 4 patients.
RESULTS: This classifier was a significant predictor of overall survival in two 
independent validation cohorts [cohort 1 (n = 214): P = 6.3 × 10(-5); cohort 2 
(n = 27): P = 3.1 × 10(-2)]. The prognostic value of the risk score was 
validated by multivariate analysis including the established markers age and 
MYCN status (P = 0.027). In the pooled validation cohorts (n = 241), integration 
of the risk score with the age and/or MYCN status identified subgroups with 
significantly differing overall survival (ranging from 35 to 100 %).
CONCLUSION: Together, the 18-gene risk score classifier can identify patients 
with stage 4 NB with favorable outcome and may therefore improve risk assessment 
and treatment stratification of NB patients with disseminated disease.

A distal portion of human chromosome 1p is often deleted in neuroblastomas and 
other cancers and it is generally assumed that this region harbors one or more 
tumor suppressor genes. In neuroblastoma, a 261 kb region at 1p36.3 that 
encompasses the smallest region of consistent deletion pinpoints the locus for 
calmodulin binding transcription activator 1 (CAMTA1). Low CAMTA1 expression is 
an independent predictor of poor outcome in multivariate survival analysis, but 
its potential functionality in neuroblastoma has not been explored. In this 
study, we used inducible cell models to analyze the impact of CAMTA1 on 
neuroblastoma biology. In neuroblastoma cells that expressed little endogenous 
CAMTA1, its ectopic expression slowed cell proliferation, increasing the 
relative proportion of cells in G(1)/G(0) phases of the cell cycle, inhibited 
anchorage-independent colony formation, and suppressed the growth of tumor 
xenografts. CAMTA1 also induced neurite-like processes and markers of neuronal 
differentiation in neuroblastoma cells. Further, retinoic acid and other 
differentiation- inducing stimuli upregulated CAMTA1 expression in neuroblastoma 
cells. Transciptome analysis revealed 683 genes regulated on CAMTA1 induction 
and gene ontology analysis identified genes consistent with CAMTA1-induced 
phenotypes, with a significant enrichment for genes involved in neuronal 
function and differentiation. Our findings define properties of CAMTA1 in growth 
suppression and neuronal differentiation that support its assignment as a 1p36 
tumor suppressor gene in neuroblastoma.

PURPOSE: Despite vast improvements that have been made in the treatment of 
children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the majority of infant ALL 
patients (~80 %, < 1 year of age) that carry a chromosomal translocation 
involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene shows a poor response to 
chemotherapeutic drugs, especially glucocorticoids (GCs), which are essential 
components of all current treatment regimens. Although addressed in several 
studies, the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon have remained largely 
unknown. A major drawback of most previous studies is their primary focus on 
individual genes, thereby neglecting the putative significance of inter-gene 
correlations. Here, we aimed at studying GC resistance in MLL-rearranged infant 
ALL patients by inferring an associated module of genes using co-expression 
network analysis. The implications of newly identified candidate genes with 
associations to other well-known relevant genes from the same module, or with 
associations to known transcription factor or microRNA interactions, were 
substantiated using literature data.
METHODS: A weighted gene co-expression network was constructed to identify gene 
modules associated with GC resistance in MLL-rearranged infant ALL patients. 
Significant gene ontology (GO) terms and signaling pathways enriched in relevant 
modules were used to provide guidance towards which module(s) consisted of 
promising candidates suitable for further analysis.
RESULTS: Through gene co-expression network analysis a novel set of genes 
(module) related to GC-resistance was identified. The presence in this module of 
the S100 and ANXA genes, both well-known biomarkers for GC resistance in 
MLL-rearranged infant ALL, supports its validity. Subsequent gene set net 
correlation analyses of the novel module provided further support for its 
validity by showing that the S100 and ANXA genes act as 'hub' genes with 
potentially major regulatory roles in GC sensitivity, but having lost this role 
in the GC resistant phenotype. The detected module implicates new genes as being 
candidates for further analysis through associations with known GC 
resistance-related genes.
CONCLUSIONS: From our data we conclude that available systems biology approaches 
can be employed to detect new candidate genes that may provide further insights 
into drug resistance of MLL-rearranged infant ALL cases. Such approaches 
complement conventional gene-wise approaches by taking putative functional 
interactions between genes into account.

BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor with dismal prognosis. 
GBM patients have a median survival of less than 2 years. GBM is characterized 
by fast cell proliferation, infiltrative migration, and by the induction of 
angiogenesis. MicroRNAs and polycomb group (PcG) proteins have emerged as 
important regulators of gene expression.
METHODS: Here we determined that miR-101 is down-regulated in GBM, resulting in 
overexpression of the miR-101 target PcG protein EZH2, a histone 
methyltransferase affecting gene expression profiles in an epigenetic manner.
RESULTS: Inhibition of EZH2 in vitro by pre-miR-101, EZH2 siRNA, or small 
molecule DZNep, attenuated GBM cell growth, migration/invasion, and GBM-induced 
endothelial tubule formation. In addition, for each biological process we 
identified ontology-associated transcripts that significantly correlate with 
EZH2 expression. Inhibition of EZH2 in vivo by systemic DZNep administration in 
a U87-Fluc-mCherry GBM xenograft mouse imaging model resulted in reduced tumor 
growth.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that EZH2 has a versatile function in GBM 
progression and that its overexpression is at least partly due to decreased 
miR-101 expression. Inhibition of EZH2 may be a potential therapeutic strategy 
to target GBM proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis.

Individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DS) have an increased risk of 
comorbid mental disorders including schizophrenia, attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder, depression, as well as intellectual disability. Although 
most 22q11.2 deletion carriers have the long 3-Mb form of the hemizygous 
deletion, there remains a large variation in the development and progression of 
psychiatric disorders, which suggests that alternative factors contribute to the 
pathogenesis. In this study we investigated whether neonatal DNA methylation 
signatures in individuals with the 22q11.2 deletion associate with mental 
disorder later in life. DNA methylation was measured genome-wide from neonatal 
dried blood spots in a cohort of 164 individuals with 22q11.2DS, including 48 
individuals diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. Among several CpG sites with 
P-value<10-6, we identified cg23546855 (P-value=2.15 × 10-7) mapping to STK32C 
to be associated with a later psychiatric diagnosis. Pathway analysis of the top 
findings resulted in the identification of several Gene Ontology pathways to be 
significantly enriched (P-value<0.05 after Benjamini-Hochberg correction); among 
them are the following: neurogenesis, neuron development, neuron projection 
development, astrocyte development, axonogenesis and axon guidance. In addition, 
we identified differentially methylated CpG sites in LRP2BP (P-value=5.37 × 
10-8) to be associated with intellectual disability (F70-79), in TOP1 
(P-value=1.86 × 10-7) with behavioral disorders (F90-98), in NOSIP (P-value=5.12 
× 10-8) with disorders of psychological development (F80-89) and in SEMA4B 
(P-value=4.02 × 10-7) with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (F20-29). In 
conclusion, our study suggests an association of DNA methylation differences at 
birth with development of mental disorder later in life in 22q11.2DS 
individuals.
